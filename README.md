## My process

In this challenge I used Nuxt 3 and TailwindCSS

### Built with

- Nuxt 3
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

By working on this challenge, I can learn various important concepts in front-end web development using Nuxt 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. I will understand how to create semantic HTML structure and implement Tailwind CSS with Flexbox and grid for responsive layouts. Additionally, I will learn to manage images and text effectively and apply TypeScript to write stronger, safer logic. By using Pinia for state management, I will also learn how to efficiently handle and retrieve data from APIs. Overall, this experience helps me deepen my understanding of responsive design and best practices in front-end development.
